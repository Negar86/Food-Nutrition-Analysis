            <p align="justify">BMI is an estimate of body fat and a good measure of your patients' risk for diseases that can occur with overweight and obesity. For adults, a healthy weight is defined as the appropriate body weight in relation to height. This ratio of weight to height is known as the body mass index (BMI).</p>
            <p align="justify">BMI = kg/m2 </p>

            <p style="text-align:justify"> BMR refers to the number of calories your body burns each day to keep you alive. BMR does not include physical activity, the process of digestion, or things like walking from one room to another.</p>

            <h3> TDEE <em>(Total Daily Energy Expenditure)</em></small></h3>

            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p align="justify">The amount of energy your body requires to run successfully.  TDEE is often used in order to calculate calorie intake for people looking to lose or gain weight.  If you want to lose weight you have to consume less calories than your TDEE, this creates a calorie deficit.  If you want to gain weight you have to consume more calories than your TDEE, this creates calorie surplus.  Obviously if you eat the same amount, you will be in calorie maintenance and your body weight will remain the same.</p>
            <h4>TDEE Calculation</h4>
            <p align="justify">TDEE consists of two factors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Basal Metabolic Rate</li>
                <li> Any Additional Energy Burned Through Exercise</li>
            <p align="justify"></p>
            <p align="justify">TDEE = BMR x Activity Level</p>
            <h4>Additional energy you burn daily:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li> Sedentary (little or no exercise) : 1.2 </li>
